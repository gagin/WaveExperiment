## Introduction

Standard feedforward neural networks typically rely on linear
transformations followed by simple non-linear activation functions
(e.g., ReLU). This project explores an alternative layer construction,
termed "\*\*WaveLayer\*\*," inspired by wave function concepts,
evaluating its performance and efficiency when used in a "\*\*Network
with WaveLayers\*\*" against standard Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) baselines on MNIST classification and SPY
RSI time-series prediction.

The primary research question was whether the WaveLayer's richer
per-connection function could yield greater parameter efficiency. While
investigating this, the study also uncovered significant insights into
the effectiveness of using periodic activation functions
(<span class="title-ref">sin</span>) within standard MLP architectures,
particularly for time-series data.

## The WaveLayer Concept

The core idea of the **WaveLayer** is to replace the scalar weight
`W_ij` with a parametric function incorporating trainable amplitude
(`A_ij`), frequency (`ω_ij`), and phase (`φ_ij`):

``` math
\text{contribution}_{ij} = A_{ij} \cdot \sin(\omega_{ij} \cdot x_i + \phi_{ij})
```

The total pre-activation input to output neuron `j` is:

``` math
\text{output}_j = \sum_{i} [ A_{ij} \cdot \sin(\omega_{ij} \cdot x_i + \phi_{ij}) ] + B_j
```

*(Note: The math directives above are intended for conversion to formats
like Markdown+MathJax/KaTeX or LaTeX. Direct RST rendering on platforms
like GitHub may show raw source).*

A network constructed using these layers introduces non-linearity and
periodicity *within* the layer transformation itself.

## Methodology

1.  **Architectures:**
    - **Network with WaveLayers:** Two-layer network:
      `Input -> WaveLayer(In, H) -> Activation -> WaveLayer(H, Out) -> Output`.
      Implemented using `GenericWaveNet` class name in `models.py`.
    - **MLP Baseline:** Two-layer `GenericMLP` (`models.py`).
    - **RNN Baselines (RSI only):** `LstmPredictor` and `GruPredictor`
      (`models.py`).
2.  **Activation Functions:** `ReLU` and `sin` tested between layers for
    the Network with WaveLayers and MLP.
3.  **Datasets:**
    - **MNIST:** Standard setup (784 input -\> 10 output).
    - **SPY RSI:** 14-day RSI prediction (14 input -\> 1 output),
      MultiIndex handled, data via `data_utils.py`.
4.  **Training:** Adam optimizer, relevant loss functions
    (MSE/CrossEntropy), early stopping for RSI. Hardware: **MacBook Air
    M2, 8GB RAM** (CPU).
5.  **Evaluation Metrics:** MNIST Accuracy (%), RSI RMSE (vs.
    persistence baseline), parameter counts, training time.
6.  **Implementation:** PyTorch, configurable via JSON (e.g.,
    `experiments.json`), modular code (`data_utils.py`, `models.py`).

## Experiment 1: MNIST Classification

### Objective

Establish baseline performance and efficiency of the Network with
WaveLayers vs MLP on image classification.

### Key Configurations

Focus on parameter-matched comparison: Network with WaveLayers (H=24,
~57k params) vs. MLP (H=72, ~57k params).

### MNIST Results

| Model Configuration | Parameters | Epochs | Test Accuracy | Approx. Train Time (s) |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| Network with WaveLayers H=24 | 57,202 | 12 | 93.54% | ~86s |
| MLP H=72 (ReLU) | 57,250 | 12 | 95.85% | ~40s |

MNIST Parameter Efficiency Comparison

*(Note: A larger Network with WaveLayers (H=128, ~305k params) was
required to reach ~95% accuracy).*

### MNIST Conclusion

On MNIST, the standard **MLP was significantly more parameter-efficient
and computationally faster** than the Network with WaveLayers, achieving
higher accuracy with the same parameters.

## Experiment 2: RSI Time Series Prediction

### Objective

Evaluate the Network with WaveLayers on periodic data (RSI) against MLP
(parameter-matched) and standard RNN baselines.

### Methodology Additions

- RNN models (LSTM H=32, GRU H=32) added.
- MLP hidden sizes adjusted (H=46, H=69) for accurate parameter matching
  against the Network with WaveLayers (H=16, H=24).

RSI Prediction Experiment Summary (Updated Training Times)

*(Note: Baseline RMSE ~4.6425. 'wave' model_type refers to the Network
with WaveLayers (\`GenericWaveNet\` class). RMSE values rounded slightly
for display.)*

### RSI Conclusion

1.  **Baselines:** GRU achieved the best accuracy (RMSE ~4.569),
    slightly edging out LSTM (RMSE ~4.577). Persistence baseline (RMSE
    ~4.64) was challenging.
2.  **MLP+Sin Strength:** The `MLP` using `sin` activation (H=69, RMSE
    ~4.587) was highly effective, nearly matching LSTM/GRU accuracy with
    significantly fewer parameters (~1.1k vs ~3.4k-4.5k) and much faster
    training time (~1.2s vs ~5.5s-8.3s).
3.  **WaveLayers vs MLP+Sin:** The Network with WaveLayers was
    consistently outperformed by MLP+Sin at equivalent parameter counts
    in both accuracy and training speed.
4.  **Parameter Efficiency & Speed:** The **\`\`MLP+Sin\`\` architecture
    offered the best balance of accuracy, parameter efficiency, and
    training speed**. GRU/LSTM were most accurate but less efficient and
    slower. The Network with WaveLayers was less efficient than MLP+Sin.
    ReLU MLPs were the fastest to train but least accurate.
5.  **Activation:** `sin` activation was crucial for MLP performance on
    RSI, significantly outperforming `ReLU`.

## Overall Discussion

### Efficiency Comparison Summary

Across both tasks, the custom **Network with WaveLayers was less
parameter-efficient and computationally slower than standard MLPs**. On
RSI, the MLP's advantage was most pronounced when using a `sin`
activation, which also proved much faster to train than RNNs.

### Hypothesis on Periodic Data

The hypothesis that the WaveLayer's periodic bias would be advantageous
on RSI data was **not supported**. The simpler MLP+Sin architecture
proved more parameter-efficient and achieved comparable or better
accuracy than the Network with WaveLayers at matched parameter counts,
while being faster to train.

### The "Wave" Inspiration and Reality

While conceptually appealing, the practical implementation of the
WaveLayer faced challenges. Its complexity likely led to optimization
difficulties and computational overhead outweighing benefits from its
inductive bias for the tasks tested.

### Effectiveness of MLP+Sin - A Key Finding

A significant outcome was the **demonstrated effectiveness of using a
standard MLP with a \`\`sin\`\` activation** for the periodic RSI time
series. This MLP+Sin approach achieved performance close to the best RNN
models but with vastly superior parameter and computational efficiency
compared to both RNNs and the Network with WaveLayers. This highlights a
practical method for incorporating periodic bias.

## Overall Conclusion

This study evaluated a novel **Network with WaveLayers** using the
custom **WaveLayer** component. Experiments on MNIST and RSI prediction
(vs MLP, LSTM, GRU baselines on a MacBook Air M2 CPU) led to two main
conclusions:

1.  The custom **Network with WaveLayers, while functional, proved less
    parameter-efficient and computationally slower** than standard MLP
    baselines on both tasks. Its inherent periodic bias did not
    translate into a competitive advantage, even on oscillating RSI
    data.
2.  A key secondary finding was the **high effectiveness and efficiency
    of using a simple \`sin\` activation function within a standard
    MLP** for the RSI time-series task. This MLP+Sin configuration
    offered a superior balance of accuracy, parameter count, and speed
    compared to the Network with WaveLayers, LSTM/GRU, and standard ReLU
    MLPs for this specific problem.

The results suggest that the added complexity of the WaveLayer did not
yield practical benefits over simpler, established methods, while also
highlighting the potential of using periodic activation functions in
standard networks for time-series modeling.
